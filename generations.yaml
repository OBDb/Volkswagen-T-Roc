    description: "The Volkswagen T-Roc is a compact crossover SUV positioned between the smaller T-Cross and larger Tiguan. Introduced in 2017, it's built on the MQB platform and features distinctive styling with a coupe-like roofline, bold character lines, and available two-tone paint schemes with contrasting roof colors. A significant facelift in 2022 updated the exterior styling and substantially improved the interior, replacing the original hard plastics with soft-touch materials and introducing a new infotainment system. The vehicle is offered with various powertrain options including turbocharged petrol and diesel engines ranging from 115 to 190 horsepower in standard models, with front or 4MOTION all-wheel drive. The performance-oriented T-Roc R variant, introduced in 2019, features a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine producing 300 horsepower. Additionally, a convertible T-Roc Cabriolet debuted in 2020, making it one of the few convertible crossovers on the market. The T-Roc combines practical compact dimensions with a relatively spacious interior, premium technology options, and distinctive styling to appeal to style-conscious buyers in the competitive compact crossover segment."
